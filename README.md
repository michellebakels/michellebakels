### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I'm not one for fancy profiles of myself and still view github as a tool more than a portfolio, however I understand a few occasional visitors may drop by to see what's going on over here so I'll try and provide some :sparkles: _guidance_ :sparkles: <br>

I do a lot of teaching and tutorials for new programmers therefore a lot of what's seen publicly here serves that purpose. Also, nearly everything I've ever built in exchange for USD is in a private repo (:confused:). There are a few repos in here that are near and dear to my heart though so let me `.filter()` them out:

#### :arrows_clockwise: 1909 X-Change
This app is being developed for the wonderful/amazing/magical members of [1909](https://weare1909.org/) which brings in and brings up South Florida entrepreneurs through accelerators, ideators, and shared community space. A common pain point of early stage start-ups is of course (... drum roll...) **lack of funding!** In order to help relieve this burden, we've created the X-Change, a skills sharing/swapping platform that allows founders to post what they need help with in _exchange_ for helping someone else with their area of expertise.<br>

To learn more about the X-Change, check out [this Racket](https://racket.com/cococo_soflo/rnae8) recorded by community building expert, Vanessa Calas, and myself for our community growth series, CoCoCo SoFlo.

#### :heart: Coding With...
Coding With... is a collection of 10 tiny software programs that explore using code as a form of meditation. Born from the [Florida Entrepreneur Club's](https://www.flent.club/) 10x10 writing challenge (and my obsessive need to overachieve) for 10 days straight I built small apps that focused my mind on a specific emotion or human characteristic in order to experiment with using software as a tool for creativity and personal development. Afterwards, I wrote up a gist describing each experience.<br>

These little apps are unpolished and breakable, and that's ok :relaxed:. Success was measured by the ability to focus on the intention while coding.<br>
This might seem a little strange, so if you'd like to understand better check out this talk I gave at [FloridaJS](https://floridajs.com/) explaining the project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMDl04DL6Tw
